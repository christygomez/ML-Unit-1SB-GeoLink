# Machine Learning - Unit 1 Skill Builder

## Getting Started
Begin by forking and cloning this repo!

We will be using Jupyter Notebooks to write python code and markdown throughout this unit. We'll also be using a number of scientific python libraries like Numpy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn. Instead of downloading all of these dependencies individually, we will download Anaconda - a package/virtual environment manager that includes all the tools we will need.

Please download [Anaconda here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/). You may use either the command line installer or the gui, but the **command line installer is recommended** since it installs useful command line tools for you.

### If you used the command-line installer
1. Navigate to this directory in a new terminal window
1. run the command: ```jupyter notebook``` *If your terminal doesn't recognize this command, you may refer to the gui installer instructions.*
1. A server will now host the `.ipynb` files located in this directory, and a new window will open in your default browser.
1. In this browser window, open the file `python-for-ml.ipynb` to begin the coding challenges.


### If you used the gui installer
1. Open the Anaconda Navigator application that was installed.
1. You should see an icon for Jupyter. Launch Jupyter.
1. Jupyter will display a file tree. Navigate to this directory.
1. open the file `python-for-ml.ipynb` to begin the coding challenges.

## Jupyter Resources
Here are a couple resources to get you going with Jupyter:
